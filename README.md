Basic Control Flow and If/Else Statements

Control Flow: when we want code to run only if something is true or not. We use the if keyword to set up conditions. If something is true the code will run, but if the condition is not true, then the code will move on. We use Comparison Operators to evaluate two items and return either true or false. These comparison operators consist of: <, <=, >, >=, ===, !===. We will include Logical Operators such as: (AND) && Logical Operator that evaluates both expressions and will return true if BOTH expressions are true. If one or both expressions are false, then this operator will return false. The (OR) || Logical Operator evaluates if one or both of the expressions are true. It will return true if one of the expressions is true, but it will return false if both expressions are false. The (NOT) ! Logical Operator will return the opposite Boolean value of what is passed to it.

These Logical Operators are evaluated in order, and the conputer will skip any redundant expressions. For instance, in an && statement, if the first expression is false, the second expression will not be evaluated because BOTH expression must be true. Same for the || statement. If the first expression is true, the second will not be evaluated because there only needs to be one true statement to fulfill the requirements of the Logical Operator.
